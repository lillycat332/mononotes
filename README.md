## Advantages
- It isn't Electron (though it does embed monaco editor)
- It's less than 100 MB, and has a smaller memory footprint than similar Electron apps
- It isn't closed source
- It's SwiftUI aside from the monaco editor, so it feels native
## Disadvantages
- The code is a mess
- I made this in like an hour
## Why
- Because a certain note taking app went closed source
- Because I can
## TODO
- Proper organisation file view in the sidebar
- Perhaps an option to disable the monaco editor in place of a lesser featured, SwiftUI only editor?
