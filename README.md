# mononotes
Mononotes is a markdown notetaking/editor app for macOS

## Advantages
- It isn't Electron (though it does embed monaco editor)
- It's less than 100 MB, and has a smaller memory footprint than similar Electron apps
- It isn't closed source
- It's SwiftUI aside from the monaco editor
## Disadvantages
- The code is a mess
- I made this in like an hour
## TODO
- Proper organisation file view in the sidebar
